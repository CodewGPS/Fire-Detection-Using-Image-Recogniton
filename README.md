# Fire Detection using Image Recognition on Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project utilizes image recognition techniques to detect fires using YOLOv5 on a Raspberry Pi. The model is trained on a dataset from Roboflow. Refer to the inferences page for inferences and more details.

## Features
- Detects fires in images and video streams in real-time.
- Optimized for running on resource-constrained devices like Raspberry Pi.
- Utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection framework.
- Preprocessed and trained on a dataset from Roboflow.
## Dataset
The dataset used for training this model is obtained from https://universe.roboflow.com/-jwzpw/continuous_fire. It consists of images containing various instances of fires.

## Model
The model used for fire detection is based on the YOLOv5 architecture, which is known for its fast and accurate object detection capabilities.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for any improvements or suggestions.
